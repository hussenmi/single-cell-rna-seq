# scRNA-seq Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw scRNA-seq data was first preprocessed. This step involved quality control measures to remove low-quality cells and genes, normalization to account for differences in sequencing depth, and identification and correction of batch effects.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: The high-dimensional scRNA-seq data was then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) via the Scanpy library. This step reduces the complexity of the data while retaining the most important variation.

3. **Clustering**: The dimensionality-reduced data was then clustered to identify groups of cells with similar gene expression profiles. This was done using the Leiden algorithm in Scanpy.

4. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Differential expression analysis was performed to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between the identified clusters. This helps in characterizing the clusters and understanding their biological significance.

5. **Visualization**: The results were visualized using various plots such as PCA plots, UMAP plots, and violin plots for differential expression results. This helps in understanding the data and the results of the analysis.

6. **Latent Variable Modeling**: The scVI toolkit was used for latent variable modeling. This step helps in further understanding the underlying structure of the data and can be used for tasks such as imputation of missing data and prediction of gene expression.
