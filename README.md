#### Overview
This project outlines a comprehensive computational pipeline to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for human pancreatic islets, aiming to cluster cells based on gene expression profiles and identify cell types using marker genes.

#### Methodology
The pipeline is meticulously structured into several sections, each addressing a critical aspect of scRNA-seq data analysis:

1- **Quality Control and Preprocessing**: I employed rigorous quality control measures to filter out low-quality cells. Subsequently, I normalized and logarithmized the data, ensuring consistency across cells for subsequent analyses.

2- **Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction**: I identified highly variable genes, and applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to linearly reduce dimensionality while preserving the most significant variance in the data. I calculated the neighborhood graph, laying the groundwork for clustering and visualization algorithms that require an understanding of cell relationships. I also employed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for non-linear dimensionality reduction, projecting data onto a two-dimensional space conducive to visual interpretation while preserving local and global structures.

3- **Batch Correction**: I utilized the ComBat method to correct batch effects among the samples, a critical step to ensure that the biological conclusions drawn from the data are not confounded by technical artifacts.

4- **Clustering Models and Fine-Tuning**: I selected the Louvain model and the Leiden model for clustering due to their efficiency and effectiveness in uncovering biological heterogeneity. I fine-tuned their resolution parameter based on performance metrics.

5- **Models Evaluation and Validation**: I evaluated and compared the two clustering models using visual inspection, performance metrics, such as the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score, and more importantly, the biological context. Based on this, I chose to proceed with the Louvain model. I then assessed the robustness of the Louvain model by applying the same clustering process to stratified subsets of the original data and comparing the outcomes.

6- **Cell Type Identification**: Marker genes were then used to annotate the identified clusters with corresponding cell types.
